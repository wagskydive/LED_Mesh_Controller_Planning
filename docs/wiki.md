# ðŸ“– LED Mesh Controller Wiki

## Overview

The LED Mesh Controller firmware coordinates multiple ESP32 nodes in a mesh network to drive LED strips. It bridges Art-Net data to DMX, runs local lighting effects and exposes a web-based console for configuration.

## Components

- **MeshManager** â€“ initializes ESP-Mesh, elects the root node and keeps track of connected nodes.
- **SettingsManager** â€“ stores configuration parameters in NVS and converts them to JSON.
- **WiFiManager** â€“ connects to a configured access point or starts a fallback AP if none is available.
- **WebServer** â€“ serves the REST API and static web console from SPIFFS.
- **LEDManager** â€“ wraps Adafruit NeoPixel for low level LED control.
- **FXEngine** â€“ runs chase, pulse, static, wipe, bounce, color cycle and complementary effects with optional AutoFX mode.
- **ArtNetReceiver** â€“ listens for Art-Net packets and forwards DMX frames.
- **DMXOutput** â€“ transmits DMX512 data over RS485 via a MAX485 driver.
- **SceneManager** â€“ saves and loads scene presets on SPIFFS.
- **MicInput** â€“ detects beats from a microphone input pin.
- **Topology API** â€“ `/status` lists mesh nodes and whether this device is the root.

## Web Console

The web UI served from `/data/index.html` allows editing settings, saving scenes and triggering playback. A node list displays all detected mesh nodes.

## Smart Features

- Complementary color effect cycles through opposing hues.
- Beat detection from the microphone triggers pulse effects.
- Node topology viewer shows which devices are connected.
