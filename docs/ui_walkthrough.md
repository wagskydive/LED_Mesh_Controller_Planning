# Web Console Walkthrough

The console exposes three panels:

1. **Settings** – configure universes, LED count and Wi-Fi. Save and restart to apply.
2. **Scenes** – create and rename scenes. Use the drawer button to open this panel.
3. **Playback** – view node status and trigger scenes from the drawer list.
